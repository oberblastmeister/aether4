TODO:

- [] add the void type
    - but don't add it to any IR!
    - instead, just add a undefined instruction
- [] add more tests
- [] add support for typedefs
- [] fix the existing graph coloring register allocator
- [] remove all record types from the ir interface, it should be fully abstract
- rewrite the process stuff to use spawn/cmd instead of eio
