TODO:

- [] fix the existing graph coloring register allocator
- [] remove all record types from the ir interface, it should be fully abstract
- [] todo: fix the entity infrastructure to remove the phantom type parameter, it's a little too complex
- [] remove the index outside of the instruction, it's kinda annoying
